<h1> About Me </h1>
<h4>👋 Hi, I’m @Grytpype-Thynne </h4>
<p>I'm an IT professional running my own MSP company, but this is my personal account, so here I'll be creating projects around:
<ul>
  <li>Home Automation with Homeassistant </li>
  <li>HAM Radio (I'm VE7DVQ) </li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi </li> 
<li>Anything else that takes my interest at the time. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently learning Git, Github and various programming languages.
I taught myself BASIC on Commodore computers back in the 1980s, and Pascal, LISP, Scheme, and C in University in the 1990s.
I am very out of practice with coding, having left most scripting/programming tasks to others while I focus on other areas of IT.
Since I'm finding creating code based projects in support of my hobbies quite interesting, I have started picking up new things. </p>
In no particular order:
<ul>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>YAML</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Microcontrollers - arduino, esp, pi pico, etc</li>
  <li>Node Red</li>
  <li>and so on...</li>
</ul>
</p>
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet. Working on my own projects to build my chops and then we'll see. <br>
- 📫 How to reach me ...<br>
<ul>     * Email addresses in my profile</ul>
